    TRAPPIST-1 system. Star and planet parameters are drawn from their 
    respective prior distributions, which are based on the observed values 
    from Gillon et al. (2017), Luger et al. (2017), and 
    Burgasser & Mamajek (2017). Longitudes of ascending node are
    drawn from the :math:`\\theta` distribution derived in the paper.
